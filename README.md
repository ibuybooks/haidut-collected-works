<h3>📎 About:</h3>

**Haidut Collected Works**
*A Comprehensive Collection of Haidut's Forum Posts, Replies, and Articles.*

This project is a high-quality LuaLaTeX compilation of Haidut's work posted on the Ray Peat Forum, from the years 2013-2024. It contains all articles, discussions, and any figures/tables/etc., that are included in the article.

<h3>📏 Improvements:</h3>

- **Proper Citations:**
  References were converted into proper superscript citations, with irrelevant/redundant citations filtered out. Links have been matched to quotes, if any, and were filtered out of the text, while remaining in the references section.
  - Normal Links:
    
    From:
    
    >http[s]://example.com
    >
    >"This quote came from the site above, but was not given a proper citation..."

    To:
    
    >"This quote came from the site above, but was not given a proper citation..."<sup>[1]</sup>
    
  - HTML links:
 
    From:
    
    >"This quote contains a html href tag HERE, which contains a link..."

    To:
    
    >"This quote contains a html href tag HERE,<sup>[1]</sup> which contains a link..."

- **Scientific Notation:**  
  Corrected notation for chemical formulas, mathematical expressions, and statistical terms.
  - Chemical formulas: "CO2" → "CO<sub>2</sub>" (CO$_{2}$)
  - Greek letters: "α" → "$\alpha$"
  - Statistical notation: "p<0.01" → *p* < 0.01 ("\textit{p} < 0.01")
  - SI units: 5mg → 5 mg, 10ml → 10 ml (proper spacing)

- **Text Standardization:**
  Ensured consistent capitalization (e.g., "gaba" → "GABA", "pubmed" → "PubMed"), corrected spelling, adjusted bold/italics/underline/coloring, and fixed grammar (minimally).

- **Typographic Enhancements:**  
  Uses proper typographic quotes, and correct (i.e. consistent) punctuation and spacing.
  - Quotes: "Hello" → “Hello” (via the `csquotes` package)
  - Punctuation: Moved punctuation inside quotes where appropriate (e.g., "word", → "word,")
  - Misc LaTeX Improvements: (e.g., "..." → "\dots{}", "—" → "--", etc. for proper typography/kerning/spacing)

- **Figures, Tables, and Images:**
  Embedded all referrenced figures, tables (as images), and other relevant images into all of the articles, for quick access.

- **Anonymization:** 
  Anonymizes usernames (e.g., "John Doe" → "Anonymous #1") while preserving Haidut's own.

- **Searchable Greek Letters:**
  A custom implimentation allows cross-viewer/platform searching of both actual Greek characters and their English counterparts (e.g., "TNF-α," "TNF-alpha," and "TNF-a" are all valid, and will yield the same results).

<h3>🔖 Notes:</h3>

- Standard 8.5"x11" paper size.
- 12 volumes, 2013-2024.
