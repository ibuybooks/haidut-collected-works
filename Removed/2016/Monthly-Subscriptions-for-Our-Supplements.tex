Hello everybody,

Over the last several months we have been getting quite a few requests to set up a system so that people can sign up for a monthly delivery of one or more of our supplements, instead of placing a manual order every time. If anybody is interested please send me a PM or email to \underLine{\textsb{info (at) idealabsdc.com}} and we will set it up.

Thanks again for your continued support.
