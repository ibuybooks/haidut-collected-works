Hello folks,

Just wanted to let everybody know that the staff running the online store will be taking some well-deserved time off in the period August 12---August 22. This means that the store will have to go on hiatus during that period. We will ship all orders that come through by 5pm on August 11. Orders placed after that will ship on August 22 when the staff comes back. If you are OK with placing an order during the period August 11 and August 22 and having it ship on August 22 then please feel free to do so. However, if you are not comfortable paying for something that has delayed shipping then please wait until August 22.

We posted a similar notice on the store webpage in case people do not see the thread on the forum. We apologize for the inconvenience and are taking measures to ensure that there will be no more hiatuses regardless of vacation plans. 

Thanks in advance for your understanding!
