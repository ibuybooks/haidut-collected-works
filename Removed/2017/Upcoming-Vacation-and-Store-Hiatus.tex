Hi all,

As we did last year, we will be going on a brief vacation and the store will be closed in the meantime. We plan on closing the store on August 3, at 6:30pm and reopen again on August 12. All orders submitted before the closing will be shipped. Sorry about the short notice but we are at the mercy of airlines and their pricing systems. As many of you know, it is neither easy nor cheap to haul b**t across the Atlantic and we just got notified by the airlines about the available flight date that we could afford.

Apologies for any inconvenience. Hopefully, 9--10 days of hiatus won't cause too much trouble.

BTW, we have at least 4 new products ready to launch when we some back! Should be an exciting fall
