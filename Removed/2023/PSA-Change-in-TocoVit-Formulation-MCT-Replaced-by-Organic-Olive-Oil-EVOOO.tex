Just a quick note that we have changed the TocoVit formulation to no longer use MCT oil as the diluent. Instead, it now uses extra-virgin organic olive oil (EVOOO)---the same oil used as a solvent in one of the Kuinone formulations. Everything else remains the same as before. 

Based on client requests and a small, randomized poll with past buyers of TocoVit it looks like the EVOOO is preferred by most people, so we decided to use that going forward instead of MCT oil. If there is sufficient demand for an MCT version, we may bring it back as a second option for TocoVit solvent/ddiluentto choose from.
