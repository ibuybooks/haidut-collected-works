I know the readers here have suspected this for a long time and we have plenty of links posted on the forum about the \enquote{Great Reset} agenda from WEF. However, until now, there was not much in terms of official acknowledgment from world leaders that this agenda is about to be adopted/implemented. Now, the Canadian PM has stated this is exactly what is in the works, at least in Canada. Also, apparently completely very \enquote{curiously,} several pro-globalization leaders keep using the same \enquote{Work Back Better} slogan borrowed from the WEF publications as a message for what awaits us. Biden, Trudeau, BJ, Merkel, etc. are among the most highly visible ones to use it and have apparently also endorsed the \enquote{never going back} to normal narrative pushed by the WEF. If that is all true, then I guess \enquote{conspiracy} has now attained the same status in politics as the words \enquote{controversial} and \enquote{paradox} in medicine---i.e., linguistic tricks used to conceal either stunning idiocy/incompetence, evil deeds, or both.
