Things are not looking good right now for most COVID-19 human trials. This is the second treatment trial to be stopped within the last 2 weeks.\textsuperscript{\cite{urlc75d148f}}

Also, this is another trial where the adverse event experienced by a patient is not disclosed immediately. As I mentioned before, this usually means something serious has happened and in the other trial where the adverse event was not disclosed it turned out that the patient had died. The company itself says that at this time the risk/benefit profile of the treatment is \enquote{unfavorable} so I am not even sure why this trial is still ongoing instead of cancelled. No wonder less than 30\% of the public say they will get a COVID-19 vaccine or recently approved drug for treating it even if they get paid to do it.
