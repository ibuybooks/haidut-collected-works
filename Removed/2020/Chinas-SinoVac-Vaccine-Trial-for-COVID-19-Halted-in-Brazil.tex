Again, due to serious adverse event (SAE). We already have threads about 3 out of the 4 Phase III trials being halted so far, and I think the one this threads is about makes it 4 out of 4.\textsuperscript{\cite{urle755db81}}

They are not saying what the SAE was, which usually means it is something serious or even deadly, as the trials with more \enquote{minor} SAE immediately disclosed what the event was. The SAE seems to have occurred in the \enquote{active} group---i.e., somebody who actually got the experimental vaccine.

\dots{}\underLine{\textsb{Brazil's health regulator has suspended trials of a Chinese-developed COVID-19 vaccine following a \enquote{serious adverse event} involving a volunteer recipient}}, according to sources cited by CNN's affiliate, CNN Brasil. Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech began Phase 3 trials of its CoronaVac in collaboration with the Brazilian Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo in late July, with an aim to recruit 130,000 volunteers. Phase 3 trials represent the final and most important testing stage before regulatory approval is sought.

The pause in testing marks a potential setback for one of China's leading vaccine candidates and comes as US drugmaker Pfizer said Monday\textsuperscript{\cite{urlb3f2aa06}} that early data from its own coronavirus vaccine showed more than 90\% effectiveness. According to a note from Brazil's National Health Surveillance Agency, \underLine{\textsb{an incident reported on October 29 led to a decision to suspend the trial in order to better evaluate the data and assess the risk}}.\textsuperscript{\cite{urlc285497e}}
