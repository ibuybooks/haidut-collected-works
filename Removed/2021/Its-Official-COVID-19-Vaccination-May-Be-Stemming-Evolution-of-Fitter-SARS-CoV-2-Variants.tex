Actual title of the press article. I won't comment much on this for obvious (read: censorship) reasons, but I will say this---Luc Montagnier was right (see first link below).\textsuperscript{\cite{url79c93b91}}

\dots{}The rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines and the mass rollout of vaccination across many countries has led to more than 800 million individuals now being fully immunized globally. \underLine{\textsb{Such accelerated immunization of a large proportion of the population at the height of the ongoing pandemic could significantly increase evolutionary pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus}}, warn the researchers.\textsuperscript{\cite{url60c38115}}

\dots{}Strikingly, the team found that the diversity of these lineages has declined globally, with this decline appearing to coincide with the onset of mass vaccination rollout. When the researchers analyzed the relationship between vaccination rates and lineage entropy in 25 countries where more than 25\% of the population was fully vaccinated, they found that \underLine{\textsb{the decline in lineage diversity was indeed correlated with increased rates of mass vaccination}}. \underLine{\textsb{Furthermore, the decline in lineage diversity was coupled with increased dominance of the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.1.617 (delta) and P.1 (gamma) variants of concern, suggesting that these variants may be \enquote{fitter} SARS-CoV-2 lineages}}.\textsuperscript{\cite{url60c38115}}

\enquote{\dots{}\underLine{\textsb{Mass vaccination may consequently go far beyond the widely reported mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and amelioration of community transmission, to include the stemming of rampant viral evolution}},} they conclude.\textsuperscript{\cite{url60c38115}}
