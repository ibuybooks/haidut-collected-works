\begin{refsection}

Nothing that people on the forum did not expect. And yet, despite this release nobody seems to be calling for indicting Pfizer, Fauci, Walensky, the FDA drug/vaccine approval committee, etc. Oh, and keep in mind all of these deaths and side effects (\underLine{\textsb{AIDS}} confirmed as one of them) were seen in \underLine{\textsb{just 90 days}} of monitoring post-vaccination. Imagine what the count of deaths and maiming is now, more than a year after the vaccination campaigns started! The only good news here is that the judge rejected Pfizer's request for 50+ years to produce this data and compelled them to release it immediately. So, the claim that Pfizer was \enquote{overwhelmed} and needed those 50+ years due to lack of staffing required to produce the documentation was apparently a lie. Which brings up another question---why aren't Pfizer and/or its officials being indicted for perjury and/or obstruction of justice at least for lying about how long it would take to produce the documentation, even if a full indictment for genocide may take years to properly prep?

\begin{tcolorbox}[quote]

Dear readers of my Substack, I want to tell you urgently that I am sitting here, as shocked as I can remember being, since I began reporting on pharmaceutical and government/ pharmaceutical predation in 1987/1988, at a rock magazine called SPIN. I've spent most of my life shocked, often disoriented, wondering if I can believe my own eyes, and trying to square the countless attacks on my own sanity with what appears to be the impossibly dark truth. For years I processed the relentless violence as some kind of possibility that I had missed something. I don't anymore. Everybody who has failed to oppose this is complicit in mass murder. There are not \enquote{two sides.} Pfizer itself can explain exactly why all the people dropping dead have died, but they felt it should be hidden for 55 years, so they could continue to murder and maim without interference. The mass media is the engine of the catastrophe, the sine qua non.

Most smoking guns are not really smoking guns, but this one \underLine{\textsb{is}}.

A group called \enquote{Public Health and Medical Professional For Transparency Documents} sued the FDA for the release of Pfizer's documents concerning adverse events from their Covid \enquote{vaccine,} which Pfizer fought to have concealed 55 years, but a courageous judge ordered them released anyway.

They wrote on their website:

\begin{quote}

Four days after the Pfizer vaccine was approved for ages 16 +, we submitted\textsuperscript{\cite{urlbf81fc72}} a Freedom of Information Act Request to the FDA for all of the data within Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine biological product file. We have now sued\textsuperscript{\cite{url1cf022ab}} the FDA for not releasing the data. Click below for court documents and for productions of Pfizer's documents from the FDA.

\end{quote}

Link.\textsuperscript{\cite{url5a9b001e}}

My God.

\underLine{\textsb{In the 90 days following EUA release of the \enquote{vaccine} they recorded 1223 deaths, and 158,000 adverse reactions, including fetal deaths, spontaneous abortions and more}}. They call this, in their encrypted, trans-human Pharma-lingo, the \enquote{post marketing experience.} [see link above]

Whose experience? Pfizer's, or the dead?

I failed to catch on to this when it was released a few days ago, for which I apologize. Mark Crispin Miller sent it out today and I realized I'd missed something incredibly important. I opened the document and began to read, as my mind short-circuited. One thinks one has seen it all, but no.

I'd heard Alex Jones apoplectically reporting on it this week but for some reason I still didn't drop what I was doing and go to it. Mike Adams reported comprehensively on it here.\textsuperscript{\cite{urleb56f19d}}

Normally I write prose, sentences, but now I am dropping a massive boulder of words, a sheer word cloud, so you can have a visual sense of the extent of the \enquote{adverse events} Pfizer outrageously and blithely calls \enquote{..of special interest.}

These \enquote{events} have never been \enquote{of special interest} to the protected class of mass media vaccine propagandists, but they are REAL. They are now here in black and white, from Pfizer's own documents. They mirror exactly what everybody who has been trying to sound the alarm has ever said; There is no mystery anymore.

Anybody who tells you these \enquote{vaccines} are safe is somewhere between hypnotized, dishonest, and malicious. Here comes the massive chunk of unprocessed text, the collection of recorded bodily catastrophes, since they crammed it all into one space. I highlighted some of them, very familiar to those of us tracking adverse events and deaths following injections, and added some occasional commentary. Read and weep, then allow yourself rage, and do whatever you can to shake people awake.

Our bodies are nothing but their field of sadistic experimentation, their wealth gain, their total self-appointed right to destroy life, while raking in billions, maybe trillions, and even guilt-tripping their endless victims for not promoting \enquote{vaccines} once they have been crippled. Even the dead are expected to promote vaccines from the grave, via their surviving loved ones. Yet \underLine{\textsb{you}} are an \enquote{anti-vaxxer.} and this is a fate worse, they make clear, than death.

Donald Trump dumped the American people into a death pit, and the current \enquote{President} has promoted nothing but vaccine genocide, reading squintingly from his Pharmaceutical Agenda teleprompter, with background wallpaper that reads: \enquote{Vaccines.Gov.} because that's all our \enquote{government} is now, a vaccine pushing death cult.

But no need to believe \enquote{anti-vaxxers} anymore---here's the data from Pfizer, of everything these monsters have \enquote{observed} in their victims, whose lives they are no insistent upon \enquote{saving} and who were healthy before the shots, but spellbound by fear, and sacrificed by an unspeakably cold-blooded media:
