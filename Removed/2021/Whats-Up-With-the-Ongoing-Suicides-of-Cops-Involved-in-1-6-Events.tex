This is more of an eyebrow raising article than solid evidence that something is afoul. Yet, still---four suicides (or should I say \enquote{suicides}) of cops directly involved on the ground during the 1/6 events, and also a large number of resignations of other cops who are on the ground that day and saw first-hand what happened. I don't think Capitol Police has had that many suicides in a period of decades before, let alone in just a few months.
