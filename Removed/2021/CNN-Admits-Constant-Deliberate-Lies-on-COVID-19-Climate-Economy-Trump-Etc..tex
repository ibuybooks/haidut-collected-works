I knew CNN was engaging in blatant COVID-19 manipulation back in March 2020 when for several days in row I saw CNN display constantly a red alert banner that said \enquote{This about to get very, very scary!} Aside from the fact that no serious journalist/news organization runs headlines like that, to this day I am sure this level of fearmongering violates state/local laws in many US jurisdictions against causing panic in the general population. Of course, no govt agency has investigated CNN (or other MSM outlets) over deliberately stoking provably unfounded fears in the general population. However, one of the links below also shows that CNN was engaged in deliberate smear campaign against Trump while he was still POTUS, and I am pretty sure there are FEC rules on blatant lies against a political opponent, or any public official running for re-election. CNN also apparently engaged in blatant lies about the economy, and \enquote{climate change} in order to further stoke fear about Trump and get people to vote against him. And if all of that was not bad enough, CNN also admits that all of its reporters openly manipulate people they interview to get them to say whatever CNN's agenda desires, and to never invite people for interviews who basically \enquote{won't play ball.} According to CNN itself, there is no such thing as \enquote{unbiased news} in MSM and \underLine{\textsb{the closest to unbiased news we can get is independent reporting/analysis similar to what we have on this forum}}. \underLine{\textsb{Yet, CNN also admits that they tirelessly lobby to have exactly such independent reporting/analysis brutally censored by Big Tech in order to \enquote{combat misinformation.}}} I just don't understand how such open, public admissions are not enough to arrest and imprison the entire leadership of CNN, or at least launch a massive criminal investigation into its \enquote{journalism} practices. Actually, since most of MSM parrots the same idiotisms as CNN, the entire MSM industry should be investigated and/or sued into oblivion for being nothing but an instrument of deception while getting multiple bailouts with taxpayers' money.

The founder of Project Veritas, who made those videos exposing the absolute abysmal fraud CNN is, claims he will take CNN to court precisely because he believes they have violated a number of federal and state laws. So, even if CNN is the darling of DOJ and won't get criminally prosecuted maybe the civil lawsuit will succeed and expose the inconvenient truth that MSM has truly become an \enquote{enemy of the people} and have nothing to offer except mental zombification on demand.

\dots{}An undercover video released by Project Veritas shows CNN technical director Charlie Chester revealing how the network purposefully painted Joe Biden in a positive light to get Donald Trump out of office. In a conversation with a Project Veritas journalist, Chester can be seen on video admitting CNN worked to make Trump look \enquote{\underLine{\textsb{unfit for office}},} while simultaneously portraying Biden as healthy to combat fears the 78-year-old was not up to holding the presidency. \underLine{\textsb{\enquote{Look what we did, we [CNN] got Trump out. I am 100\% going to say it, and I 100\% believe that if it wasn't for CNN, I don't know that Trump would have got voted out}}\dots{} \underLine{\textsb{I came to CNN because I wanted to be a part of that}},} Chester says in the video. \underLine{\textsb{He also detailed bringing in \enquote{medical people} to tell a story that was \enquote{all speculation} about Trump's hand shaking}}. \underLine{\textsb{\enquote{We were creating a story there that we didn't know anything about. That's what---I think that's propaganda,}}} he said.\textsuperscript{\cite{urlc980y1q3}}

\dots{}Chester revealed the opposite was done for Biden during the 2020 presidential race. \enquote{\underLine{\textsb{We would always show shots of him [Biden] jogging and that [he's] healthy, you know, and him in aviator shades. Like you paint him as a young geriatric}},} he said, saying \underLine{\textsb{the strategy was a \enquote{deflection} of his age and numerous public gaffes}}.\textsuperscript{\cite{urlc980y1q3}}

\dots{}\enquote{\underLine{\textsb{It's going to be our [CNN's] focus}}. \underLine{\textsb{Like our focus was to get Trump out of office, right}}? \underLine{\textsb{Without saying it, that's what it was, right}}? \underLine{\textsb{So, our next thing is going to be climate change awareness}},} he said. Chester added he doesn't specifically know what that coverage looks like, but it \underLine{\textsb{will likely include fear-mongering videos of \enquote{the effects it's having on the economy,} as well as \enquote{decline in ice} and}} \underLine{\textsb{\enquote{weather warming}}.}\textsuperscript{\cite{urlc980y1q3}}

\dots{}CNN's coverage of Covid-19 reflected a formula for the way the network capitalizes on news, Chester said. \enquote{It's fear,} he said. \enquote{Like, fear really drives numbers.} The technical director added that, while the \enquote{happiest} news might cause people to go and spend time with their families, \enquote{Fear is the thing that keeps you tuned in, I would imagine. What's the scariest thing next, you know?} When CNN puts a good-news segment at the end of a program, Chester added, it's like \enquote{the ice cream to alleviate, you know, like, everything that you've been through, like something sweet to end it with, because everything else is like doom and gloom.} Beyond making fear-based coverage decisions---\enquote{if it bleeds, it leads}---CNN often presents its stories in a biased way, Chester admitted. \enquote{There's no such thing as unbiased news,} he said. \enquote{It just doesn't exist. There's too many agendas. There's too many people that have jobs, that need to feed families, for it to be unbiased.} Chester said \enquote{grassroots} podcasts, often done out of people's basements, are the closest thing to unbiased news. Ironically, CNN has pushed for censorship of smaller, independent voices in the name of fighting \enquote{misinformation.} Chester said CNN and rival Fox News are essentially the same in their biases, except they stand on opposing sides of the political spectrum. He added that all CNN reporters are able to manipulate people in interviews---using inflection, repetition, and other techniques---to spin the focus of a story to their liking. \enquote{Listen to the way they ask questions, because they're not actually asking questions,} he said. \enquote{What they're actually doing is, they're telling the person what to say. It's an art form in there. There's an art form to it.} Chester added that \enquote{it's always like leading them in a direction before they even open their mouths. And the only people that we will let on the air, for the most part, are the people that have a proven track record of taking the bait.} Such manipulation is powerful enough \enquote{to change the world,} Chester said. It worked for CNN in helping to oust Trump, he noted, \enquote{but look at the other side, how devastated they were. So, were we the good guys or the bad guys? It depends on which side you were looking at it from, you know?}\textsuperscript{\cite{urlfads08ya}}
