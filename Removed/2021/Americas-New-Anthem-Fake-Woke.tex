If this is the song with the most first-week views collected on iTunes ever, it probably says something about its relevance\dots{}

\dots{}I think it's crazy I'm the one who they labeled as controversial

And Cardi B is the role model for twelve year old girls

There's rappers pushing Xanax at the top of the Billboard

But if I mention race in a song I'm scared I'll get killed for it

It's backwards, it's getting exponentially dumb

It's more difficult to get a job than purchase a gun

Eminem used to gay bash and murder his mom

And now he doesn't want fans if they voted for Trump

We're ashamed to be American, you should probably love it

'Cause you have the right to say it and not get strung up in public

\underLine{\textsb{[Video version: \enquote{Cause you have the right to hate it and not get stoned to death in public}]}}

As children we were taught how to walk and talk

But the system wants adults to sit down and shut up

Cancel culture runs the world now, the planet went crazy

Label everything we say as homophobic or racist

If you're white then you're privileged, guilty by association

All our childhood heroes got MeToo'd or they're rapists

They never freed the slaves, they realized that they don't need the chains

They gave us tiny screens, we think we free 'cause we can't see the cage

They knew that race war would be the game they'd need to play

For people to pick teams, they use the media to feed the flame

They so fake woke, facts don't care about feelings

They know they won't tell me what to believe in

They so fake woke, same old, safe zones

They so fake woke, facts don't care about your feelings

I think it's crazy how these people screaming \enquote{facts} but they fake woke

Hate their neighbor 'cause he wears a mask or he stays home

Has a daughter but his favorite artist said he slays hoes

Picks her up from school, music slaps on the way home

Censorship's an issue 'cause they choose what they erase

There's a difference between hate speech and speech that you hate

I think Black Lives Matter was the stupidest name

When the system's screwing everyone exactly the same

I just wanna spend Thanksgiving Day with food and my family

Without being accused of celebrating native casualties

We got so divided as black and white and political

Republicans are bigots, libtards if you're liberal

There's riots in our streets and it's just getting worse

Y'all screaming defund the police, y'all are genius for sure

They're underfunded already, they're way too busy to work

Order food and call the cops, see what reaches you first

Segregation ended, that's a lie in itself

That was a strategy to make us think that we're trying to help

They knew that racism was hot if they designed it to sell

We buy up every single box and divide us ourselves

They so fake woke, facts don't care about feelings

They know they won't tell me what to believe in

They so fake woke, same old, safe zones

They so fake woke, facts don't care about your feelings

Use violence to get peace and wonder why it isn't working

That's like sleeping with a football team to try and be a virgin

Politicians are for sale and someone always makes the purchase

But you and I cannot afford it, our democracy is worthless

If a man has mental illness call him crazy, say it silently

When country's going crazy we accept it as society

Get sick and take a pill when the side effects get you high

You get addicted like these rappers dying fighting with sobriety

Censoring the facts turns our children into idiots

They claim it's for our safety, I'll tell you what it really is

Removing information that empowers all the citizens

The truth doesn't damage points of view that are legitimate

They're tryna change amen to amen and women

How'd we let them make praying a microaggression?

Instead of asking God for the strength to keep winning

We cheat to get ahead and then we ask Him for forgiveness

Feminism used to be the most righteous of fights

But these days it feels like they secretly hate guys

I don't trust anyone who bleeds for a week and don't die

I'm just kidding, but everything else that I said is right

They so fake woke, facts don't care about feelings

They know they won't tell me what to believe in

They so fake woke, same old, safe zones

They so fake woke, facts don't care about your feelings.\textsuperscript{\cite{url982g3b329}}
