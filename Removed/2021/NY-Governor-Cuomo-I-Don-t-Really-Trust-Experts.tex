The article would have been hilarious if it was not a confirmation of the absolute corruption and charade when it comes to all things \enquote{pandemic.} After mocking Trump's dismissal of \enquote{experts} throughout all 4 of his years as President, and especially during 2020, it is now apparently perfectly normal and acceptable for his political opponents to break with \enquote{expert} advice when it comes to political decisions affecting the lives/health of millions of people. The real question is this---if all those politicians have shown that \enquote{listen to the experts} is just a political slogan and they certainly don't follow it, then why should we? It looks like the Israelis are waking up to the COVID-19 fraud, now that they have been told lockdowns won't be lifted even after vaccination. I wonder how long before the rest of the Western world does too\dots{} and\dots{} now I know why National Guard troops are still in DC--to protect \enquote{Beijing Biden} after people realize they have been had and start taking to the streets.

\dots{}Cuomo has made his position on health experts clear in recent days, even saying during a Friday press conference that he doesn't \underLine{\textsb{\enquote{really trust them.} \enquote{When I say \enquote{experts} in air quotes, it sounds like I'm saying I don't really trust the experts,}}} \underLine{\textsb{the governor said}}. \underLine{\textsb{\enquote{because I don't}}.} The quote now looks especially bad in the context of a new report from the New York Times, detailing Cuomo's troubled relationship with health officials in his state during the pandemic.\textsuperscript{\cite{urlasd908yh}}
