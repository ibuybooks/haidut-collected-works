I am posting this as something corroborating Peat's comments that the risks of many so-called \enquote{long} COVID-19 after-effects and pathologies is not higher compared to the risk caused by infection with other viruses. Myocarditis is probably the most commonly mentioned risk of getting a COVID-19 infection, and the study below suggests the risk of getting myocarditis from COVID-19 is comparable to the risk from other viruses, and maybe even lower. Now, the risk of myocarditis from getting a COVID-19 vaccine is higher than the natural infection. How much higher, we still don't exactly know, but the data so far is not looking too favorable for the vaccines.\textsuperscript{\cite{url27d1249b}}
